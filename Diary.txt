1. In interrupt.c
   Changed default_handler_hardware() function, tried to complete use external event to wakeup tasks,
   in this function, I still need to complete the part to use IPC message to tell specific task(send message to specific task).
2. In task.c
   In activate_task() function, don't know to config the logic,
   (1) If there is no Lito_TCB instance for this task, then initial one, and fill it
   (2) If exists, what's next?????

   New function called reset_task(), I want to use this function to reset the TCB, especially for those task triggered by external event(might be aperiodic tasks) and clock event(periodic tasks).

   Need to design Running queue.
   Need to design function_shell function.
   Need to design how to quit the execution and how to remove itself from the TCB_list or the task_list.
   Need to design a function to set the task status.
3. For messgae.c
   Maybe it's time to consider for designing the IPC.

1. In task.h
   Designed the running queue,
   (1)It's a hash table,hash key is the priority of job
   (2)Use linkedlist to solve "Hash Collisions"
2. In task.c
   Completed the running queue inilization,insertion and remvoe function.
   Changed the interface of task_list_remove and TCB_list_remove fucntion,make them return the removed element.

   Next step, reconfig the activate_task function,let it calls running_queue_insert function
